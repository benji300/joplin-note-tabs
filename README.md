### Keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts can be assigned in user options via `Tools > Options > Keyboard Shortcuts` to all [commands](#commands) which are assigned to the `Tools>Favorites` menu context.
In the keyboard shortcut editor, search for the command label where shortcuts shall be added.

## User options

This plugin adds provides user options which can be changed via `Tools > Options > Note Tabs` (Windows App).

> **NOTE** - If `default` is set for an advanced style setting, the corresponding default color, font family, etc. will be used to match the common App look.

> **NOTE** - In case color settings shall be overwritten, they must be specified as valid CSS attribute values, e.g. `#ffffff`, `rgb(255,255,255)`, etc.

## UI Tweaks

If option `Show breadcrumbs below tabs` is enabled in the settings it might be useful to disable the default breadcrumbs below the note title.
Follow these steps to hide it via the `userchrome.css` stylesheet:

- Open Joplin
- Navigate to `Tools > Options > Appearance` and open `Show Advanced Settings`
- Click `Edit` below `Custom stylesheet for Joplin-wide app styles` to open `userchrome.css` in a text editor
- Paste the following snippet into the file
- Save your changes and restart Joplin to see the changes

```css
.rli-editor
  > div
  > div
  > div
  > div[style^="padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;"]
  > button {
  display: none !important;
}
```

> **NOTE** - Since there is currently no unique attribute for the breadcrumbs, this can only be done using the workaround from above. However, the behavior may change with each version and it may happen that it no longer works.
