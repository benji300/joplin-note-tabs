/**
 * Allows creating and managing dialogs. A dialog is modal window that
 * contains a webview and a row of buttons. You can update the update the
 * webview using the `setHtml` method. Dialogs are hidden by default and
 * you need to call `open()` to open them. Once the user clicks on a
 * button, the `open` call will return an object indicating what button was
 * clicked on.
 *
 * ## Retrieving form values
 *
 * If your HTML content included one or more forms, a `formData` object
 * will also be included with the key/value for each form.
 *
 * ## Special button IDs
 *
 * The following buttons IDs have a special meaning:
 *
 * - `ok`, `yes`, `submit`, `confirm`: They are considered "submit" buttons
 * - `cancel`, `no`, `reject`: They are considered "dismiss" buttons
 *
 * This information is used by the application to determine what action
 * should be done when the user presses "Enter" or "Escape" within the
 * dialog. If they press "Enter", the first "submit" button will be
 * automatically clicked. If they press "Escape" the first "dismiss" button
 * will be automatically clicked.
